IP:
--> nureric number
--> it is the identy of any devices that connected with network(internet)
--> every devices need unique ip for communication on network
--> it consists 2 part: 
	1.network-address 
	2.host-address

IPv4:
--> use 32bit numeric number.
    2^32 = 4billion unique number will produced for ipv4 address.
--> it use decimal number with seperate (dot.)

example: 192.168.0.103
	 --- --- - ---
	 octed.octed.octed.octed

--> it produce generally 4 number address
--> every number(---) called "OCTED"
--> OCTED is a unit of digital information in computing and telecommunications that consists of "Eight Bit".
    it means, every ipv4 (example: 192.168.0.103) number can't cross limit of [2^8]
    it will limited with 0-255 decimal number    



IPv6:
--> it use 128bit numeric number.
--> uses hexadecimal number with seperate colon.

example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

--> every ipv6 number limitation of [2^128]
    it will limited with [3.41^38] that is huge for near decands
